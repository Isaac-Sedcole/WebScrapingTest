# WebScrappingTest

### Purpose
I created this app in order to figure out how web scraping worked a little bit better. 
This was in order to see if it could be implemented into my steam game picker project - unfortunately due to a few different factors such as the following this was not possible:
- Steam has an age gate which could I suppose be bypassed in order to get to the main nitty gritty of the information needed
- The data that I was after was the user defined tags - these were generated using javascript meaning that the process took a long time per execution
- Due to the length of time it was taking it would not be applicable to the uses I was hoping for - needing live data to be manipulated using what was collected from this
- It would be miles easier overall when/if steam come out with new functions for their api to look at the individual steam games in more detail by themselves.


Painful but rewarding - It was very difficult just trying to get the code to run full stop - a full couple days of trouble shooting just to check to see if my code was working at all.
